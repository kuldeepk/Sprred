Perhaps the<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/pda/2010/jun/14/digital-media-apple\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 68, 187);\">FTC’s recent interest</a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>in Apple’s ad policies delayed the blockade, but multiple industry sources take it as a foregone conclusion that it’s only a matter of time before Apple prevents Google completely from serving ads. If and when that does eventually happen, the mobile ad space could change irrevocably.</p><p>Clearly, there is a very real danger that Apple will create a domino effect across the mobile advertising industry if it turns off the switch for AdMob. Let’s just think this through. If Apple were to block Google’s ad network from serving ads on iPhone and iPads, which make up the lions share of OS ad requests according to<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/08/18/millennial-media-android-os-grew-by-47-percent-in-july-ipad-requests-up-327-percent/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 68, 187);\">Millennial’s latest data</a><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;</span>(55 percent), Google would be forced to focus on the Android market. Android devices are no doubt<a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/05/comscore-android-market-share-continues-to-gain-on-the-iphone/\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: rgb(34, 68, 187);\">growing fast</a>, and even overtaking RIM’s share of ad requests according to some reports. Advertisers are no doubt going to want to spend money on targeting Android users. And Google, who develops and distributes the Android platform, would need to make up for the loss of the Apple ecosystem from AdMob’s mobile ad network by generating more revenue through Android.</p><p>Of course, Google would be stupid to explicitly close their ecosystem like Apple, but if the company wants to financially capitalize on the growth of the Android platform, it might make sense to favor its own ad network above others.</p></span></span>
